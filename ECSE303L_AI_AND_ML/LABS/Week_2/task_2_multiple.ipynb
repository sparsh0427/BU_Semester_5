    "20. G3 - final year math grades (numeric: from 0 to 100, output target)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "To learn multiple linear regression and practice handling categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "- To load the data and print first 5 rows\n",
    "- Transform categorical features into numerical features. Use either one hot encoding, label encoding or any other suitable preprocessing technique.\n",
    "- Define X matrix (independent features) and y vector (target feature)\n",
    "- Train Linear Regression Model (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression class)\n",
    "- Print 'Mean Squared Error' (MSE) obtained on the same dataset i.e. same X and y (sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error function)\n",
    "- Predict on a numpy array defined by you\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> new_data = np.array([1,0,1,.....,30,20]).reshape(1,-1)\n",
    ">>> print(\"Predicted grade:\",model.predict(new_data))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further fun (will not be evaluated)\n",
    "- Train LassoRegression and RidgeRegression as well. Read about them from scikit-learn user guide.\n",
    "- *Step-up challenge*: Get down the MSE (mean squared error) below 3.25 using linear models\n",
    "- Implement multiple linear regression from scratch\n",
    "- Plot loss curve (Loss vs number of iterations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Helpful links\n",
