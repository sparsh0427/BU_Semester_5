## Challenge Week 3
Logistic regression is a predictive analysis technique to perform classification when dependent variable is binary. It is possible to extend this method in multiclass classification problems as well.

### How to use

#### Colab
Open task 1 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-3/blob/master/task_1_logistic_divorse.ipynb)<br>
Open task 2 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-3/blob/master/task_2_logistic_diabetes.ipynb)

How to get the data using wget?
```python
# Divorce Dataset for Task 1
!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-3/raw/master/data/divorce.csv

# Diabates Dataset for Task 2
!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-3/raw/master/data/diabetes_data.csv
```
#### Local
This is not a huge repository therefore can easily be downloaded.
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-3.git

# Go to project directory
$ cd challenge-week-3

# Open up the jupyter notebook if installed
$ jupyter notebook
```
