## Challenge Week 5
Choosing and defining right evalauation metrics is critical for any machine learning application. It helps us evaluate the models and choose good algorithm which fits our dataset as well as problem.

In this challenge, we will explore various classification metrics and see how logistic regression does against decision tree.

### How to use

#### Colab
Open task 1 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-5/blob/master/task_1_classification_metrics.ipynb)<br>
Open task 2 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-5/blob/master/task_2_lr_vs_dt.ipynb)

How to get the data using wget?
```python
# Ozone Levels Dataset for Task 1
!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-5/raw/master/data/ozone_levels_train.csv

!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-5/raw/master/data/ozone_levels_train.csv
```

#### Local
This is not a huge repository therefore can easily be downloaded.
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-5.git

# Go to project directory
$ cd challenge-week-5

# Open up the jupyter notebook if installed
$ jupyter notebook
```
