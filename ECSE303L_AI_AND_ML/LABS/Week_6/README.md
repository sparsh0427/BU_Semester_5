## Challenge Week 6
Understanding which model performs better with respect to your dataset and objective is a critical step in machine learning.
Moreover, it is crucial to know how to make your particular model perform better than usual.

In this challenge, we will explore the concepts of overfitting, underfitting and cross validation over a variety of models we have studied so far via visualization and understand how to improve a model's performance using techniques like regularization and basic hyperparameter tuning.

### How to use

#### Colab
Open task 1 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-6/blob/master/task_1_linear_reg.ipynb)<br>
Open task 2 notebook in colab: &emsp;[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-6/blob/master/task_2_dt_log.ipynb)

How to get the data using wget?
```python
# Bike Dataset for Task 1
!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-6/raw/master/data/bike.csv

# Employee Attrition Dataset for Task 2
!wget https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-6/raw/master/data/attrition.csv
```

#### Local
This is not a huge repository therefore can easily be downloaded.
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/DeepConnectAI/challenge-week-6.git

# Go to project directory
$ cd challenge-week-6

# Open up the jupyter notebook if installed
