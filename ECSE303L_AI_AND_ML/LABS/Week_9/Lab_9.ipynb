The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. …) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore, the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.\n",
